In a world that has been plunged into a seemingly eternal winter, Michael
must find any remaining civilizations and save humanity from certain extinction.
Michael finds the charred remains of a campfire and strange  footprints leading off
into the mountains. He has a tough decision to make, should he follow or head 
his own way?

Michael chooses to follow up the mountain. At the top, he finds
a strange looking individual. He asks the man his name and the man responds...

"hooga-booga-booga" followed by some various grunting noises.
Michael's first thought is that the man has lived outside of mainstream
society all his life and therefore does not speak English.
Upon further examination, Michael finds out that the man is
simply a lunatic dancing around in the woods talking gibberish.

Michael saw a mushroom on the ground and thought it looked delicious. Michael
picked it up and ate it. Then he saw the trees start to sway and the mountains
starting to rumble. "Hello Michael". Michael turned back to see the mountain talking to him. 

"Uh-oh" thought Michael. He looked down in his hand and saw the half eaten mushroom dissolving
away. He glanced back up at the mountain wondering where the voice could have come from.
The mountain grumbled again. "Wake up, Michael. Please wake up." Michael blinked, when his eyes
opened up again the mountain landscape had faded away and as his vision cleared he saw tubes coming
out of his arm and a rythmic beeping overwhelmed his hearing. Something squeezed his hand. He glanced
upwards. "Barbara, is that you?" The lady squeezing his hand looked up at him. She burst into tears.
"Yes, it's me. Welcome back, we missed you." Michaels last memories came flooding back to him, the bus
that was barreling towards him must have not stopped in time. He feels a tear drop down his cheek,
"I am happy to be back. I love you Barbara."
