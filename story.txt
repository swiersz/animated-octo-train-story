In a world that has been plunged into a seemingly eternal winter, Michael
must find any remaining civilizations and save humanity from certain extinction.
Michael finds the charred remains of a campfire and strange  footprints leading off
into the mountains. He has a tough decision to make, should he follow or head 
his own way?

Michael chooses to follow up the mountain. At the top, he finds
a strange looking individual. He asks the man his name and the man responds...

"hooga-booga-booga" followed by some various grunting noises.
Michael's first thought is that the man has lived outside of mainstream
society all his life and therefore does not speak English.
Upon further examination, Michael finds out that the man is
simply a lunatic dancing around in the woods talking gibberish.
